Are you running power, data, audio, video or all of them. </p><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_20/img/Im41.png" /><p>When it comes to data cables it is important to consider the possibility of interference and if it is not shielded correctly and placed too close to power cables you will receive a lot of EMI (Electrical Magnetic Interference) as the electricity that passes through the power cable acts as an electromagnet, and creates interference along any adjoining or parallel cables. As we all know it is not advised to run power and data cables together in parallel. </p><div class="inline-2"><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_20/img/Im49.png"/><p><b>Chasing out different materials?</b> Within domestic applications you will most probably only ever chase out the following: Brick/Masonry/Concrete/Plaster: The best chaser on the market for this application that we have used would have to be the Metabo MFE 40 Wall Chaser not only does it provide a clean-cut line but the amount of dust/debris it removes with the Hoover attachment is a game changer especially when working within habited households.</p></div><p><b>Depth and size of chases - Regulations</b> </p><p>There are many things to consider when evaluating this and the Building Regulations of Wales highlights them perfectly  </p><p><em>"Vertical chases should not be deeper than 1/3 of the wall thickness or, in cavity walls, 1/3 of the thickness of the leaf; (b) horizontal chases should not be deeper than 1/6 of the thickness of the leaf of the wall; (c) chases should not be so positioned as to impair the stability of the wall, particularly where hollow blocks are used."</em> </p><p>Note: The inner 'leaf' = <b>Load-bearing wall</b> </p><p>The outer 'leaf' = <b>Non load-bearing wall</b> </p><p><b>Example:</b> <em>Wall thickness is 100mm thick therefore the chase depth must not be cut more than 33.3mm.</em></p><p>How to secure the cable in the chase There is a variety of ways to fix the cable to the wall, all depending on your personal preference and the circumstances of the job, but here are some popular options. </p><div class="inline-3"><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_20/img/Im57.png" /><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_20/img/Im59.png" /><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_20/img/Im61.png" /></div><div class="inline-3"><p>All Round Band: </p><p>Oval Conduit: </p><p>Capping: </p></div><div class="inline-3"><p>When securing cable, use a small length of the band and secure it back with red plugs and screws, this restricts any movement in the cable, be careful not to screw too tight and damage the cable</p><p>This is slid over the cable to provide full round protection and is very quick but must ensure depth and width are correct for a snug fit. All round band can be placed on additionally to secure it further</p><p>This not only secures the cable but also provides protection from a trowel when plastering, can be easier to fix with nails through the mortar of the brick but can be difficult to sit flush</p></div><hr><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_20/img/Im63.png" /><p>Every tradie has that one story which will haunt them forever, below is our top three stories sent in from you the readers  </p><p><b>Story 1 -</b> "I put my foot through the ceiling while the customer was walking around the job with me" </p><p>That will take a whole lot to fix  </p><p><b>Story 2 -</b> "Guy got electrocuted by touching a main buss on a 2,000A service. Co-worker hit him at full speed to knock him off with his hard hat. Alternated CPR between 4 of us for an hour and a half until ambulance got there. Saved the guys life and he was back at work 6 months later with no lasting effects from it." </p><p>Talk about a shocking experience at work </p><p><b>Story 3 -</b> "Myself and my butty both had new work vans and then decided to race through some country lanes, only from him to brake suddenly, causing me to rear end him and spin the van on a 180 and put him in a ditch. Had to speak to the farmer and ask him to sort us out and pull him out of the ditch"</p><p>Good effort  </p><hr><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_20/img/Im70.png" /><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_20/img/Im72.png" /><p>The biggest part of being a tradesman is looking after your tools, and van and staying on top of paperwork... but the most important tool you own is your MIND.
