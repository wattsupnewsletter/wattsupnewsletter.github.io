            <p>Below are all the codes that we need to know when carrying out an EICR.</p>

            <p>C1 - Danger present, risk of injury, immediate remedial action required</p>
            <p>C2 - Potential danger, urgent remedial action required </p>
            <p>C3 - Improvement recommendation</p>
            <p>FI - Further investigation required without delay N/A - Not applicable </p>
            <p>LIM - Limitation</p>
            <p>X - Danger to, or possible discrepancy with DNO equipment </p>


            <p>C1, C2 and FI all lead to a report being unsatisfactory, although The X code is possibly dangerous this does not make the report unsatisfactory. In the instance where you do find something wrong with the DNO equipment, you should contact the DNO immediately. </p>


            <p>If a C1 is found while testing and you're unable to make it safe due to several reasons such as the customer not wanting to pay to fix it, it not being a quick fix, you're not allowed to turn the power off or any other unforeseen circumstances, a danger notice should be submitted to the appropriate organisation, for example the NICEIC. </p>

            <p>An AFDD aka "Arc Fault Detection Device", is an electrical safety device whose job it is to detect electrical arcs within a wiring system. It works by monitoring the electrical current for irregularities that could suggest the presence of an arc in the circuit. This can be caused by damaged wiring or loose connections. </p>

            <img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_26/img/X36.png" class="mx-auto"/>
            <p>If an arc fault is detected, the AFDD will trip, and the circuit will be isolated. This is to prevent the risk of a fire and ensure the hazard is no longer present. </p>


            <p>Where Should We Install AFDD's? </p>
            <p>Page 86, section 421.1.7 of BS7671 states the following: </p>
            <p>"Arc fault detection devices (AFDD) conforming to BS EN 62606 shall be provided for single-phase AC final circuits supplying socket-outlets with a rated current not exceeding 32 A in:  </p>
            <p>Higher Risk Residential Buildings (HRRB) </p>
            <p>Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO) </p>
            <p>Purpose-built student accommodation</p>
            <p>Care homes </p>
            <p>For all other premises, the use of AFDDs conforming to BS EN 62606 is recommended for single-phase AC final circuits supplying socket-outlets not exceeding 32 A." </p>

            <p>This shows the importance of the device, especially where they may be a high volume of people. </p>

            <p>Take Pride &amp; Show Off Your Work!</p>
            <p>Taking pride in your work is not just about doing the job, but it's about striving for more and leaving a lasting impression through the quality of your work. Never forget to let people know what you are doing, take photos and videos and post your work on your social media, you never know who will see it. </p>

            <p>The More you Learn, The More You Earn!</p>
            <p>Famous saying from Warren Buffet but applicable to any discipline, don't limit yourself to just domestic for example, gain exposure in as much as you can, for example industrial and commercial. Never know where opportunities may present themselves. </p>

            <p>Your Network is Your Networth</p>
            <p>This is vital for staying in tune with your industry, the latest trends and opportunities. A study carried out suggested 55% of millennials use their network for their next job opportunity, that could be you so say yes to the next event. </p>

            <p>Always Check Isolation</p>
            <p>Whenever you are working on live equipment regardless if you colleague says the system is safe a quick 30 second check yourself is always a must, as that could be the difference between life and death. </p>

                    <p>One Man Routing - Cable Tongue</p>
                    <p>When carrying out cable installations with a team of two, the task is simplified as one individual can focus on feeding the cable while the other can handle pulling. However, when working solo, this process becomes notably more challenging. The cable tongue is a helpful piece of kit by navigating the cable route beforehand, you can then subsequently affix the cable to it and independently pull it through to the desired destination. </p>

It's obvious that you can put it in a cavity to check the space prior to installation but it is best utilized with the cable tongue, where you can place the camera on the exit of the cable route and feed the cable tongue and once the cable tongue is visible on the camera set-up on the exit you are all good to go to connect your set wire.  </p>
