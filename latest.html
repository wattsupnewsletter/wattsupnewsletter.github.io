<img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_18/img/Im9.png" /><p> Dug's First Christmas, with generosity in the air, and the season to be giving, it looks like its all in full swing...  </p><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_18/img/Im11.png" /><p>At Watt's Up we want to thank each and every one of you for the support, and to show our appreciation we are giving away £500 worth of tools in a CHRISTMAS GIVEAWAY! </p><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_18/img/Im18.png" /><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_18/img/Im20.png" /><p>One thing as an electrician that we overlook &amp; underestimate is how easy it is to get overloaded with our work schedule and organisation of the business. Below are some useful tips to hopefully save you money and most importantly your TIME!  </p><p>TIME is MONEY! </p><div class="inline-2"><p>1. Paperwork Staying organised with paperwork is a crucial part of being an electrician. If it’s owning your own company or working for someone. We have all been there where we have forgot to do a test report or forgot to send out an invoice.  I overcome this by always carrying a tablet or laptop with me. With this I can get my reports done on-site or in the van. This also gives me instant access Tradify where I manage all my quotes &amp; scheduling. </p><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_18/img/Im22.png" /></div><div class="inline-2"><p>2. Van Stock Rummaging through your van for 30 minutes straight to find a Wago only to find out you do not have one. Which then you have to waste more time going to the wholesaler to get one.  Keeping your van stocked up and organised is a must, check out the spreadsheet example where the price and part number is logged and updated every so often.</p><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_18/img/Im30.png" /></div><div class="inline-2"><p>3. Documenting Your Work  When working on site and within people's home, it is always good practice to record and document everything you have done post-job, this can be done with simple photos. This ensures that once you leave the job, you know your work and the property you are in is left in a good condition, and if someone tries to say something different you are covered by your photos. </p><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_18/img/Im32.png" /></div><div class="inline-2"><p>This information can be stored in a free Google Drive. </p><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_18/img/Im34.png" /></div><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_18/img/Im36.png" /><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_18/img/Im40.png" /><p>Tradify the all-in-one job management tool, making it easy to manage your quotes, estimates, invoices, payments, scheduling &amp; more! </p><p>Quoting has never been easier! Tradify's newest feature, quote options, lets you offer all of your options on one quote, saving you time and limiting revisions with your customers. </p><p>Jimbo's favourite feature is the ability to have pre-made emails, invoices and quotes. This saves him so much time as he only has to change very small details and can get a quote out in as little as 60 seconds </p><p>Exclusive Discount Code: JIMBO50 50% off for 3 months </p><a href="https://bit.ly/3T5KFjF">Click here for a 14 day Trial! </a><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_18/img/Im47.png" /><p>What is Neutral Diversion Current...? </p><p>Diverted neutral currents is a topic which is becoming more important. An event can occur if there is a break in the protective earth and neutral (PEN) conductor in the distribution network, supplying an installation with a TNC-S earthing arrangement. This then has the potential for current to flow down the protective conductor, exposed metallic structural parts of the building, water/gas pipes and much more. (We don’t need to say how dangerous that is)   </p><p>You might ask how does this happen. Well there is lots of events that can cause this such as:  </p><p>Deterioration in electrical equipment Cable damage </p><p>Poor/Loose connections </p><p>There isn't anything us as electricians can do to stop this, but what we can do is make more electricians aware about the danger and how we can keep ourselves safe from it. </p><p>Example of the danger:</p><p> If you are replacing a consumer unit and haven't checked the earth </p><p>leakage current on the bonding conductor, then please do.  </p><p>When this is disconnected while doing your board change this could have a large amount of current flowing through it which is extremely dangerous as we know. </p><p>PLEASE go and watch the following videos for a much better understanding from people who are hugely respected in the electrical industry and make yourself aware of more danger. </p><a href="https://rb.gy/enjoyw"> Diverted Neutral Currents - Apprentice 121 </a><a href="https://rb.gy/uwpsx8"> Diverted Neutral Currents - John Ward </a><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_18/img/Im57.png" /><p>Every tradesman knows their tools inside and out. But can you guess these everyday tools/materials that we as electricians use...  </p><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_18/img/Im59.png" /><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_18/img/Im61.png" /><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_18/img/Im63.png" /><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_18/img/Im71.png" /><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_18/img/Im73.png" /><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_18/img/Im75.png" /><p>The biggest part of being a tradesman is looking after your tools, van and staying on top of paper work... but the most important tool you own is your MIND. </p><p>We will be donating 10% of any profit made from this newsletter.
