                <p>Why We Use Contactors  </p>
                <p>Firstly what is it?, well to keep it simple it's a device used for switching circuits on and off.  </p>
                <p>How Do They Work? A contactor is essentially a switch for electricity and has three important parts: </p>
                <p>Coil: Think of this as a magnet that loves to pull things. When we give it power, it pulls a lever. Contacts: These are like tiny bridges. When electricity passes through they either connect (close) or separate (open). </p>
                <p>Enclosure: This encases all the components to ensure no dust or debris comes into contact with them </p>
                <p>When the coil is energized it opens/closes the contacts depending on how that line is configured. </p>
                <p>Normally Open gets energized and becomes Normally Closed </p>
                <p>Normally Closed gets energized and becomes Normally Open </p>
                <img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_21/img/X14.png" class="mx-auto"/>
                <p>What Are They Used For? They are essential for frequently switching power in various scenarios, designed for enduring many cycles of operation. They excel in higher- power applications due to their capability to handle low voltages and </p>
                <p>currents while cycling a much higher voltage/current circuit on and </p>
                <p>off. These versatile devices can be configured to either activate a circuit (normally open) or deactivate it (normally closed). They find </p>
                <p>common use as electric motor starters, providing safety features like power cut-off, short circuit protection, overload protection, and under- </p>
                <p>voltage protection, especially in electrical vehicles. </p>
                <p>Difference Between Contactors &amp; Relays Contactors and relays are like different superheroes for handling </p>
                <p>electricity. Contactors are the big, strong heroes made for heavy-duty </p>
                <p>tasks with lots of power, while relays are like the smaller heroes meant for lighter jobs. Here are some differences: </p>
                <p>Power Handling: </p>
                <p>Contactor: Handles big power tasks. Relay: Deals with smaller power jobs, usually around 5A-15A. </p>
                <p>Contact Setup: Contactor: Usually works in a way that the circuit is only on when it </p>
                <p>gets power. </p>
                <p>Relay: Can work with circuits on (NO) or off (NC) when powered. Safety Features: </p>
                <p>Contactor: Has more safety features, like spring-loaded contacts and overload protection to stop things from getting too hot. </p>
                <p>Relay: Not as many safety features. Size and Speed: </p>
                <p>Contactor: Bigger, heavier, and slower. Relay: Smaller, lighter, and faster. </p>
                <p>Cost and Power Use: </p>
                <p>Contactor: More expensive and uses more power. Relay: Usually cheaper and uses less power. </p>
                <p>So, it's like having a big, tough hero for the hard jobs (contactor) and </p>
                <p>a smaller, quicker hero for the easier tasks (relay). </p>
