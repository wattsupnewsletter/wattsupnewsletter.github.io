<p>Good Afternoon. It's Friday, Nov. 1st, and we're simplifying the topic of power factor with beer...🤔</p>

    <p>Power Factor measures how effectively electrical power is used on a single
    piece of equipment like a motor or a commercial building. This means that if the
    power factor is poor, it can result in wasted energy and, in some cases, extra
    charges from the electricity supplier.</p>
</div>

<p>There are 3 main properties of</p>
<p>POWER FACTOR</p>
<img src="/assets/img/newsletters/Volume16/X17.png" class="d-block img-fluid mb-2 rounded mx-auto" />

<div style="text-align: left;">
    <p>To understand power factor you need to understand the 3 above elements, and what better way to explain it than with a beer?</p>
    <p>The beer analogy is commonly used to describe the power factor as it is easier to understand. The more beer the better value for money in the glass. The more foam the less value for the money, no one wants a foamy pint🤔</p>

<h4 style="color: black;">Obtaining The Information</h4>
<div style="text-align: left;">
    <p>There are many products out there that provide key information to calculate power factor. The equipment used needs to be able to monitor and test the following...</p>
</div>

<img src="/assets/img/newsletters/Volume16/X21.png" class="d-block img-fluid mb-2 rounded mx-auto" />

<div style="text-align: left;">
    <p>The <a href="https://cauk.tv/pel-series/" style="color: var(--theme-primary);">PEL 104</a> is an amazing piece of kit which automatically calculates the PF by measuring the phase difference between voltage and current waveforms. This eliminates the need for manual calculations, ensuring quick and accurate PF monitoring.</p>

<div style="text-align: left;">
    <h4 style="color: black;">Importance of a good Power Factor</h4>
    <h5 style="color: black;">Bills</h5>
    <p>Often commercial and industrial electricity invoices will likely see charges and information for the amount of kW, kWh's, kVA's and kVArh's used. Some will also have reactive power charges.</p>
    <h5 style="color: black;">Extra Charge</h5>
    <p>The suppliers charge more for poor power factor as it causes several issues for the grid such as an increase in demand on the grid due to more current flow.</p>
    <h5 style="color: black;">Issues</h5>
    <p>Cables are designed to only be able to take a certain amount of current before failure and with unexpected current being drawn due to poor power factor, this can cause cable damage. This is one reason why they penalise for poor power factor, it can be looked at like a fine.</p>
    <h4 style="color: black;">What's a good Power Factor</h4>
</div>

<img src="/assets/img/newsletters/Volume16/X33.png" class="d-block img-fluid mb-2 rounded mx-auto" />

<div style="text-align: left;">
    <h5 style="color: black;">1.0: Perfect Power Factor</h5>
    <p>A good power factor is generally considered to be close to 1, or unity (1.0)</p>
    <h5 style="color: black;">0.95-1.0: Ideal Power Factor</h5>
    <p>0.95-1.0: High or Unity Power Factor, this is ideal. It means that the system is very efficient, with very little wasted energy.</p>
    <h5 style="color: black;">0.8-0.95: Acceptable Power Factor</h5>
    <p>Many utility companies consider this acceptable, although there may be some energy inefficiency due to reactive power.</p>
    <h5 style="color: black;">0-0.8: Low Power Factor</h5>
    <p>Indicates significant inefficiencies in the system, usually due to a high amount of reactive power.</p>

    <h4 style="color: black;">How to Improve your Power Factor</h4>
    <p>There are many ways power factor can be improved, but some of the most common ones are the following</p>

    <p><u>PF Correction Capacitors:</u> These can be installed to offset reactive power, bringing the power factor closer to 1.</p>
