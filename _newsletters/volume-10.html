    <h4 style="color: black;">What is Premature Collapse?</h4>
    <p>Premature collapse is the unexpected failure of a structural support that maintains electrical cables. A collapse of the support can occur due to various factors, such as:</p>
    <ul style="text-align: left;">
        <li>Fire</li>
        <li>Mechanical Stress</li>
        <li>Environmental Conditions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In the event of a collapse, the electrical cables can hinder firefighting efforts, causing disruptions to critical services and even endangering lives. An example is from 6th April 2010, when a fire started in the Shirley Towers, Southampton UK. While the fire was being tackled, two firefighters became entangled in cables that had fallen from melted plastic trunking. As a result, the firefighters sadly lost their lives, and this could of been avoided...</p>

    <h4 style="color: black;">BS7671 Requirements for Premature Collapse</h4>
    <p>Regulation 521.10.202 of BS 7671:2018 states <u><i>"Wiring systems shall be supported such that they will not be liable to premature collapse in the event of a fire."</i></u></p>

    <p>This is very self explanatory from a reader's perspective but how do you actually apply this?</p>

    <h4 style="color: black;">How & Where To Support Cables To Prevent Premature Collapse?</h4>
    <p>Referencing the regulation, it has 4 notes which explains the how and where details in more depth.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Note 1 - Wiring systems hanging across access or egress routes may hinder evacuation and firefighting activities.</li>
        <li>Note 2 - Cables installed in or on steel cable containment systems are deemed to meet the requirements of this regulation.</li>
        <li>Note 3 - This regulation precludes, for example the use of non-metallic cable clips or cable ties as the sole means of support where cables are clipped to exposed surfaces or suspended under cable tray and the use of non-metallic cable trunking as the sole means of support of the cables therein.</li>
        <li>Note 4 - Suitably spaced steel or copper clips, saddles or ties are examples that will meet requirements of this regulation.</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="/assets/img/newsletters/Volume10/X21.png" class="d-block img-fluid mb-2 rounded mx-auto"/>

    <h4 style="color: black;">Can Plastic Plugs Be Used?</h4>
    <p>Common and valid question if you are fitting metal fixings, in the NAPIT On-Site Solutions it states the following:</p>

    <p><i>"It is often asked if plastic plugs are an acceptable method of fixing supports with regard to premature collapse. Plastic plugs have been used to fix wiring systems for many years, including fire alarm systems used where there is a particular risk of fire. Whilst cables such as mineral insulated are specified because of their properties to withstand heat. Historically plastic plugs have not been a concern. <u>The intent of this Regulation is to prevent the use of non-metallic clips, ties and wiring systems as the sole means of support.</u> Therefore, plastic plugs are acceptable providing they have been correctly selected and installed."</i></p>

            <p><b>Metal Cable Ties</b></p>
            <p>These can be used on cable trays, baskets or where your fixings are adjustable.</p>

            <p><b>Metal Clips</b></p>
            <p>These are perfect if you are clipping a cable directly to the surface of the wall.</p>

            <p><b>Trunking Clips</b></p>
            <p>These are great if you are installing plastic trunking as they will still hold the cables even in the event of a fire.</p>

<p>Cleats, saddle clips, p-clips, conduit saddles & even all round band are ways to fix your cable to a surface, but they all have their issues. They can be slow to install and just a overall pain.</p>
<p>Imagine a solution that is x3 faster, safer and simpler.</p>
<p>Introducing LINIAN Clips which only requires you to drill a hole, slide the clip over the cable or conduit, and push or tap it in. No bulky tray of fixings, no plugs, no screws, no washers, just a bag of LINIAN Clips.</p>

<p>To top it off, they are fire-rated so they'll hold cables securely in case of fire which comply with 18th Edition Wiring Regulations. As you read previously, this could be a literal lifesaver.</p>

    <h5 style="color: black;"><b>Surge In Demand For Three-Phase Supply</b></h5>
    <p>Many of the homes across the world, especially the UK, have 70's/80's electrical wiring. In previous decades, the single-phase supply was adequate. Today, however, our household electricity needs grow year-on-year. Coming into force in 2025, the Future Homes Standard is a government initiative requiring new homes to reduce carbon emissions by 75%. Notably, it omits electricity supply. Installing single-phase supplies in new homes has been the norm since before WWII back when lights were the main household load. Now, our homes do more and will do even more in the future such as EV Charging, Heat Pumps, Hot Tubs, Showers, Battery Charging System and much more</p>

    <h5 style="color: black;">Solar Power Revolutionized 2.0</h5>
    <p>Recently researchers have developed an organic photovoltaic film that is both waterproof and flexible, allowing a solar cell to be put onto clothes and still function correctly after being rained on or even washed, which is a gamechanger for the industry to reduce weight and more importantly how we can fix them to buildings.

    <h5 style="color: black;">Growing Apprenticeship Opportunities</h5>
    <p>Rishi Sunak has announced from the <b>1st April onwards</b> that the UK are to be implementing a regulation change where small to medium-sized electrical businesses will save on apprentice hire costs. This is only applicable to people aged 21 and under, on average we see a saving of approximately <b>Â£2,000 over a 4-year apprenticeship.</b></p>

    <h5 style="color: black;">UK EV Charging Grant</h5>
    <p>Under the new rulings, EV drivers who live in cities & more populated areas and do not have access to their garage will be able to claim up to <b>75%</b> off the cost to buy and install a charging socket, up to a maximum of <b>Â£350</b>. Check out the local gov website for more as this could be a great marketing opportunity.</p>
