    <p>Electrical safety takes priority in everything we do as electricians, to ensure we all keep to the same standards after each installation an EIC (Electrical Installation Certificate) is completed.</p>
    <h4 style="color: black;">Why use an Electrical Installation Certificate</h4>
    <p>The EIC ensures that all electrical work complies with the latest BS 7671 (IET Wiring Regulations) standards. It serves several important functions:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><b>Safety Verification</b></li>
        <li><b>Legal Compliance</b></li>
        <li><b>Record Keeping</b></li>
        <li><b>Insurance</b></li>
        <li><b>Property Sales/Renting</b></li>
    </ol>

<p>Trends come and go, we take a deep dive into some inventions that were very short-lived due to their peculiar solutions.</p>

<div style="text-align: left;">
    <h4 style="color: black;">Electrified Water... Who Needs Soap?</h4>
    <p>In the early 1900s, "electrified water" was hailed as a revolutionary innovation.</p>

    <p>By 1904, electrified water was promoted as a soap-free method for sterilizing and cleaning clothes. A <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84031081/1913-03-02/ed-1/seq-13/" style="color: var(--theme-primary);">1913 advertisement</a> praised this "wonderful new invention" for its novel application of electricity. The trend extended to drinking and <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86063579/1911-12-08/ed-1/seq-2/" style="color: var(--theme-primary);">watering plants</a> with electrified water. In the 1920s, one physician even recommended dipping hands in it as a hangover remedy.</p>
    <p>Although electrified water wasn't hazardous (as the power was usually cut off before human contact), it ultimately failed to deliver on its promises. It couldn't clean clothes effectively without soap.</p>

    <h4 style="color: black;">Electrical Belts and Corsets</h4>
    <p>In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, electric belts and corsets were marketed as health devices. These products claimed to cure everything from impotence to indigestion by sending mild <a href="https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47e0-fce3-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99" style="color: var(--theme-primary);">electric currents</a> through the body. Despite their popularity, they were largely ineffective and eventually fell out of favour.</p>

    <h4 style="color: black;">Radiation at Your Feet</h4>
    <p>Known as fluoroscopes or shoe-fitting fluoroscopes, these devices were used in shoe stores to allow customers to see the bones of their feet inside shoes. The machines emitted high levels of radiation, often with little to no shielding. Prolonged exposure could cause burns, radiation sickness, and an increased risk of cancer. They were eventually banned after the dangers of radiation became widely understood.</p>
