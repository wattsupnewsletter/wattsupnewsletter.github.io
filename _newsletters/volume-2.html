<h4><b>There is a different procedure for EV chargers!</b></h4>
<p>As we know the everyday RCD's we fit are 30mA rated, but... did you know to test an EV charger many manufactures include a 6mA Type B RCD or RDC DD, and the majority of test equipment we use on-site does not hit that requirement.</p>
<p><b><u>How to get around this!</u></b></p>
<p>Ensure that the tester you are using, has the capability for the installation, so commissioning can be signed off correctly.</p>
