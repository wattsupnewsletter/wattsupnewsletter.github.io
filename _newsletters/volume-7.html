<h3><b>Why We Use Contactors</b></h2>
<p>Firstly what is it?, well to keep it simple it's a device used for switching circuits on and off.</p>
<div style="text-align: left;">
    <p><b>How Do They Work?</b></p>
    <p>A contactor is essentially a switch for electricity and has three important parts:</p>
    <p><u>Coil:</u> Think of this as a magnet that loves to pull things. When we give it power, it pulls a lever.</p>
    <p><u>Contacts:</u> These are like tiny bridges. When electricity passes through they either connect (close) or separate (open).</p>
    <p><u>Enclosure:</u> This encases all the components to ensure no dust or debris comes into contact with them</p>
    <p>When the coil is energized it opens/closes the contacts depending on how that line is configured.</p>
    <p><u>Normally Open</u> gets energized and becomes <u>Normally Closed</u></p>
    <p><u>Normally Closed</u> gets energized and becomes <u>Normally Open</u></p>
</div>
<img src="/assets/img/newsletters/Volume7/X14.png" class="d-block img-fluid mb-2 rounded mx-auto"/>

<div style="text-align: left;">
    <p><b>What Are They Used For?</b></p>
    <p>They are essential for frequently switching power in various scenarios,
    designed for enduring many cycles of operation. They excel in higherpower
    applications due to their capability to handle low voltages and currents while
    cycling a much higher voltage/current circuit on and off. These versatile
    devices can be configured to either activate a circuit (normally open) or
    deactivate it (normally closed). They find common use as electric motor
    starters, providing safety features like power cut-off, short circuit
    protection, overload protection, and undervoltage protection, especially in
    electrical vehicles.</p>
</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">
    <p><b>Difference Between Contactors & Relays</b></p>
    <p>Contactors and relays are like different superheroes for handling
    electricity. Contactors are the big, strong heroes made for heavy-duty tasks
    with lots of power, while relays are like the smaller heroes meant for lighter
    jobs. Here are some differences:</p>
</div>


<div style="text-align: left;">
    <p><u>Power Handling:</u></p>
    <p>Contactor: Handles big power tasks.</p>
    <p>Relay: Deals with smaller power jobs, usually around 5A-15A.</p>

    <p><u>Contact Setup:</u></p>
    <p>Contactor: Usually works in a way that the circuit is only on when it gets power.</p>
    <p>Relay: Can work with circuits on (NO) or off (NC) when powered.</p>

    <p><u>Safety Features:</u></p>
    <p>Contactor: Has more safety features, like spring-loaded contacts and overload protection to stop things from getting too hot.</p>
    <p>Relay: Not as many safety features.</p>

    <p><u>Size and Speed:</u></p>
    <p>Contactor: Bigger, heavier, and slower.</p>
    <p>Relay: Smaller, lighter, and faster.</p>

    <p><u>Cost and Power Use:</u></p>
    <p>Contactor: More expensive and uses more power.</p>
    <p>Relay: Usually cheaper and uses less power.</p>
</div>
<p>So, it's like having a big, tough hero for the hard jobs (contactor) and
    a smaller, quicker hero for the easier tasks (relay).</p>

<p>Drilling different types of materials comes with its challenges but it's
always important to know that you are drilling the correct materials with the correct bit.</p>

        <p><b>Auger & Brad Point Drill Bits</b></p>
        <p>Both bits are used for timber drilling. Auger bits are really good
        for drilling through 2x4's for possible cables runs and brad bits are for more
        precision drilling typically mounted wood to walls</p>

        <p><b>Tungsten Carbide Tipped DiamondShaped Bit</b></p>
        <p>Typically used for ceramic tiles as it provides a clean precise cut
        while avoiding any cracking or chips, must drill with use of water or
        lubrication as excessive heat will cause damage</p>

        <p><b>HSS & Cobalt Bit</b></p>
        <p>HSS drill bits are allaround that can be used on materials like wood,
        plastic and softer metals. On the other hand, cobalt drill bits are made for
        tougher materials, like stainless steel and cast iron. They have more durability
        and can handle higher temperatures.</p>
