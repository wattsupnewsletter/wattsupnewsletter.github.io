<p>One thing as an electrician that we overlook & underestimate is how
easy it is to get overloaded with our work schedule and organisation of
the business. Below are some useful tips to hopefully save you money
and most importantly your <b>TIME!</b><p>

<p><b><u>TIME is MONEY!</u></b></p>

        <h4>1. Paperwork</h4>
        <p>Staying organised with paperwork is a crucial part of being an electrician. If
           it’s owning your own company or working for someone. We have all been there where
           we have forgot to do a test report or forgot to send out an invoice. I overcome
           this by always carrying a tablet or laptop with me. With this I can get my reports
           done on-site or in the van. This also gives me instant access Tradify where I manage
           all my quotes & scheduling.</p>

        <h4>2. Van Stock</h4>
        <p>Rummaging through your van for 30 minutes straight to find a Wago only to find out you
            do not have one. Which then you have to waste more time going to the wholesaler to get
            one. Keeping your van stocked up and organised is a must, check out the spreadsheet example
            where the price and part number is logged and updated every so often.</p>

        <h4>3. Documenting Your Work</h4>
        <p>When working on site and within people's home, it is always good practice to record and
            document everything you have done post-job, this can be done with simple photos.</p>
        <p>This ensures that once you leave the job, you know your work and the property you are in
            is left in a good condition, and if someone tries to say something different you are
            covered by your photos.</p>
        <p>This information can be stored in a free Google Drive.</p>

<h4>What is Neutral Diversion Current...?</h4>
<p>Diverted neutral currents is a topic which is becoming more important.
An event can occur if there is a break in the protective earth and
neutral (PEN) conductor in the distribution network, supplying an
installation with a TNC-S earthing arrangement. This then has the
potential for current to flow down the protective conductor, exposed
metallic structural parts of the building, water/gas pipes and much
more. (We don’t need to say how dangerous that is)</p>

<p>You might ask how does this happen. Well there is lots of events that
can cause this such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Deterioration in electrical equipment</li>
    <li>Cable damage</li>
    <li>Poor/Loose connections</li>
</ul>

<p>There isn't anything us as electricians can do to stop this, but what we
can do is make more electricians aware about the danger and how we
can keep ourselves safe from it.</p>

<p><b>Example of the danger:</b></p>
<p>If you are replacing a consumer unit and haven't checked the earth
leakage current on the bonding conductor, then please do.
When this is disconnected while doing your board change this could
have a large amount of current flowing through it which is extremely
dangerous as we know.</p>

<p>PLEASE go and watch the following videos for a much better
understanding from people who are hugely respected in the electrical
industry and make yourself aware of more danger.</p>

<p>The biggest part of being a tradesman is looking after your tools, van, staying on top of paper work... but the most
