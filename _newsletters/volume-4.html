<p>Every year new electrical innovation's are introduced to the world, but let's go back in time to when these ground breaking innovations were created.</p>
<p>Try to guess in what order these devices were founded.</p>

<p>Although it's overlooked the CPC is probably the most important conductor, so let's learn more...</p>

        <h4><b>1. Sizing Your CPC</b></h4>
        <p>
            This is not used commonly in domestic installations, but if you do a lot of commercial work,
            this Adiabatic equation will help calculate the CSA of the CPC. When oversizing your CPC on
            a large commercial job, it can potentially lead to thousands of pounds wasted.

        <h4><b>2. CPC Colour Identification</b></h4>
        <p>
            The green and yellow colour identification combination shall cover from a minimum of 30% and
            at most 70%. For example 40% yellow and 60% green. This regulation is commonly misconceived
            to what percentage you should sleeve a cable.

        <h4><b>3. Un-insulated CPC</b></h4>
        <p>
            The CPC is intentionally not insulated in T&E cable to make sure that if the cable is accidentally
            cut or drilled, there's a higher likelihood of encountering the CPC first. This is an important
            safety measure.

<h2>Why is being able to detect DC leakage so important?</h2>
<p>DC leakage is now increasingly prevalent due to Electric Vehicle
batteries, Solar PV & battery storage systems. If more than 6mA of
DC leakage flows in a circuit, then all AC, A & F type RCDs will be
‘blinded’ & therefore may not trip in a fault condition.</p>

<p>The installation of a ‘B’ type RCD or ‘RDC DD’ would then pick up the
pure DC leakage current & therefore trip if there is more than 6mA of
DC leakage.</p>

<p>The bigger picture with detecting DC leakage is also that it can
propagate to different properties, meaning a house without any DC
current generating equipment could be effected by a neighbour who
has - therefore the detection of DC leakage is vitally important. At the
time of writing this proposal, the TIS 570 is the only combined AC &
DC leakage clampmeter currently readily available on the UK market.</p>

<p>DC leakage, if left unchecked can also cause corrosion within the
fabric of metal &/or metal reinforced buildings.</p>
