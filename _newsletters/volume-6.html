<h3><b>Perfect Angled Drilling</b></h3>
<p>There are many times on site where you have sockets placed in awkward
positions and unfortunately, you have to figure out ways to route cables
with minimal disruption to the property/premises.</p>
<p>Below we have provided a graphical example of how to overcome this
issue, especially when it comes to calculating the angles of drilling
through walls.</p>
<p>One example this can be applied to, is when you are installing an outside
socket but the internal socket you are connecting too is not directly
behind the outside socket, but rather further down the wall, with
obstacles in the way.</p>

<p>When chasing out walls within a commercial or domestic property there is a lot to consider, like the following:</p>
<p><b>How many cables are you fitting in a channel?</b></p>
<p>You must consider the purpose that each cables serves. Are you
running power, data, audio, video or all of them.</p>

<p>When it comes to data cables it is important to consider the possibility
of interference and if it is not shielded correctly and placed too close
to power cables you will receive a lot of EMI (Electrical Magnetic
Interference) as the electricity that passes through the power cable
acts as an electromagnet, and creates interference along any
adjoining or parallel cables. As we all know it is not advised to run
power and data cables together in parallel.</p>

        <p><b>Chasing out different materials?</b></p>
        <p>Within domestic applications you will most probably only ever chase out the following:</p>
        <p><u>Brick/Masonry/Concrete/Plaster:</u></p>
        <p>The best chaser on the market for this application that we have used would have to be
            the Metabo MFE 40 Wall Chaser not only does it provide a clean-cut line but the amount of
            dust/debris it removes with the Hoover attachment is a game changer especially when working
            within habited households.</p>
    </div>

<div style="text-align: left;">
<p><b>Depth and size of chases - Regulations</b></p>
<p>There are many things to consider when evaluating this and the
    Building Regulations of Wales highlights them perfectly.</p>

<p><i>"Vertical chases should not be deeper than 1/3 of the wall thickness
or, in cavity walls, 1/3 of the thickness of the leaf; (b) horizontal
chases should not be deeper than 1/6 of the thickness of the leaf of
the wall; (c) chases should not be so positioned as to impair the
stability of the wall, particularly where hollow blocks are used."</i></p>
</div>


<div style="text-align: left;">
    <p><i>Note:</i></p>
    <p>The inner 'leaf' = <b>Load-bearing wall</b></p>
    <p>The outer 'leaf' = <b>Non load-bearing wall</b></p>
    <p><i><u><b>Example:</b></u></i></p>
    <p><i>Wall thickness is 100mm thick therefore the chase depth must not be cut more than 33.3mm.</i></p>
</div>


<p><b>How to secure the cable in the chase</b></p>
<p>There is a variety of ways to fix the cable to the wall, all depending on
your personal preference and the circumstances of the job, but here
are some popular options<p>

        <img src="/assets/img/newsletters/Volume6/Im57.png" class="d-block img-fluid mb-2 rounded mx-auto"/>
        <p>All Round Band:</p>
        <p>When securing cable, use a small length of the band and secure it back with red plugs and
            screws, this restricts any movement in the cable, be careful not to screw too tight and damage
            the cable</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col">
        <img src="/assets/img/newsletters/Volume6/Im59.png" class="d-block img-fluid mb-2 rounded mx-auto"/>
        <p>Oval Conduit:</p>
        <p>This is slid over the cable to provide full round protection and is
            very quick but must ensure depth and width are correct for a snug fit. All round
            band can be placed on additionally to secure it further</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col">
        <img src="/assets/img/newsletters/Volume6/Im61.png" class="d-block img-fluid mb-2 rounded mx-auto"/>
        <p>Capping:</p>
        <p>This not only secures the cable but also provides protection from a
            trowel when plastering, can be easier to fix with nails through the mortar of
            the brick but can be difficult to sit flush</p>

<p>Every tradie has that one story which will haunt them forever, below is our top three stories sent in from you the readers</p>
<p>Story 1 - "I put my foot through the ceiling while the customer was
walking around the job with me"</p>
<p>That will take a whole lot to fix</p>
<p>Story 2 - "Guy got electrocuted by touching a main buss on a 2,000A
service. Co-worker hit him at full speed to knock him off with his hard
hat. Alternated CPR between 4 of us for an hour and a half until
ambulance got there. Saved the guys life and he was back at work 6
months later with no lasting effects from it."</p>
<p>Talk about a shocking experience at work</p>
<p>Story 3 - "Myself and my butty both had new work vans and then
decided to race through some country lanes, only from him to brake
suddenly, causing me to rear end him and spin the van on a 180 and
put him in a ditch. Had to speak to the farmer and ask him to sort us
out and pull him out of the ditch"</p>
<p>Good effort</p>
