Are you running power, data, audio, video or all of them. </p><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_20/img/Im41.png" /><p>When it comes to data cables it is important to consider the possibility of interference and if it is not shielded correctly and placed too close </p><p>to power cables you will receive a lot of EMI (Electrical Magnetic Interference) as the electricity that passes through the power cable </p><p>acts as an electromagnet, and creates interference along any </p><p>adjoining or parallel cables. As we all know it is not advised to run power and data cables together in parallel. </p><p>Chasing out different </p><p>materials? </p><p>Within domestic applications you </p><p>will most probably only ever chase out the following: </p><p>Brick/Masonry/Concrete/Plaster: </p><p>The best chaser on the market </p><p>for this application that we have used would have to be </p><p>the Metabo MFE 40 Wall </p><p>Chaser not only does it provide a clean-cut line but the amount of </p><p>dust/debris it removes with the </p><div class="inline-2"><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_20/img/Im49.png" /><p>Hoover attachment is a game changer especially when working within habited households.  </p></div><p>Depth and size of chases - Regulations  </p><p>There are many things to consider when evaluating this and the Building Regulations of Wales highlights them perfectly  </p><p>"Vertical chases should not be deeper than 1/3 of the wall thickness or, in cavity walls, 1/3 of the thickness of the leaf; (b) horizontal </p><p>chases should not be deeper than 1/6 of the thickness of the leaf of </p><p>the wall; (c) chases should not be so positioned as to impair the stability of the wall, particularly where hollow blocks are used." </p><p>Note: The inner 'leaf' = Load-bearing wall </p><p>The outer 'leaf' = Non load-bearing wall </p><p>Example: </p><p>Wall thickness is 100mm thick therefore the chase depth must not be cut more than 33.3mm. </p><p>How to secure the cable in the chase There is a variety of ways to fix the cable to the wall, all depending on </p><p>your personal preference and the circumstances of the job, but here </p><p>are some popular options. </p><div class="inline-3"><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_20/img/Im57.png" /><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_20/img/Im59.png" /><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_20/img/Im61.png" /></div><div class="inline-3"><p>All Round Band: </p><p>Oval Conduit: </p><p>Capping: </p></div><div class="inline-2"></div><div class="inline-3"><p>When securing </p><p>This is slid over the </p><p>This not only secures the cable but also </p></div><div class="inline-3"><p>cable, use a small </p><p>cable to provide full round protection and </p><p>provides protection </p></div><div class="inline-2"><p>length of the band </p><p>from a trowel when </p></div><div class="inline-3"><p>and secure it back with red plugs and </p><p>is very quick but must ensure depth </p><p>plastering, can be easier to fix with nails through the </p></div><div class="inline-2"><p>screws, this restricts </p><p>and width are </p></div><div class="inline-3"><p>any movement in </p><p>correct for a snug fit.
