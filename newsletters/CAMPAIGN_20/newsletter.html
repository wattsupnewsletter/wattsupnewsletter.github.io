          <h1>Perfect Angled Drilling </h1>
          <p>There are many times on site where you have sockets placed in awkward positions and unfortunately, you have to figure out ways to route cables with minimal disruption to the property/premises. </p>
          <p>Below we have provided a graphical example of how to overcome this issue, especially when it comes to calculating the angles of drilling through walls. </p>
          <p>One example this can be applied to, is when you are installing an outside socket but the internal socket you are connecting too is not directly behind the outside socket, but rather further down the wall, with obstacles in the way. </p>

          <p>When chasing out walls within a commercial or domestic property there is a lot to consider, like the following: </p>
          <p>How many cables are you fitting in a channel?</p>
          <p>You must consider the purpose that each cables serves. Are you running power, data, audio, video or all of them. </p>
          <img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_20/img/Im41.png" class="mx-auto"/>
          <p>When it comes to data cables it is important to consider the possibility of interference and if it is not shielded correctly and placed too close to power cables you will receive a lot of EMI (Electrical Magnetic Interference) as the electricity that passes through the power cable acts as an electromagnet, and creates interference along any adjoining or parallel cables. As we all know it is not advised to run power and data cables together in parallel. </p>

            <p><b>Chasing out different materials?</b>Within domestic applications you will most probably only ever chase out the following: Brick/Masonry/Concrete/Plaster: The best chaser on the market for this application that we have used would have to be the Metabo MFE 40 Wall Chaser not only does it provide a clean-cut line but the amount of dust/debris it removes with the Hoover attachment is a game changer especially when working within habited households.</p>
          </div>

          <p><b>Depth and size of chases - Regulations</b></p>
          <p>There are many things to consider when evaluating this and the Building Regulations of Wales highlights them perfectly  </p>
          <p><em>"Vertical chases should not be deeper than 1/3 of the wall thickness or, in cavity walls, 1/3 of the thickness of the leaf; (b) horizontal chases should not be deeper than 1/6 of the thickness of the leaf of the wall; (c) chases should not be so positioned as to impair the stability of the wall, particularly where hollow blocks are used."</em></p>
          <p>Note: The inner 'leaf' = <b>Load-bearing wall</b></p>
          <p>The outer 'leaf' = <b>Non load-bearing wall</b></p>
          <p><u><b>Example:</b></u></p>
          <p><em>Wall thickness is 100mm thick therefore the chase depth must not be cut more than 33.3mm.</em></p>
          <p>How to secure the cable in the chase There is a variety of ways to fix the cable to the wall, all depending on your personal preference and the circumstances of the job, but here are some popular options. </p>


          <div class="col">
              <img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_20/img/Im57.png" />
              <p>All Round Band: </p>

              <p>When securing cable, use a small length of the band and secure it back with red plugs and screws, this restricts any movement in the cable, be careful not to screw too tight and damage the cable</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col">
              <img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_20/img/Im59.png" />
              <p>Oval Conduit: </p>
              <p>This is slid over the cable to provide full round protection and is very quick but must ensure depth and width are correct for a snug fit. All round band can be placed on additionally to secure it further</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col">
              <img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_20/img/Im61.png" />
              <p>Capping: </p>
              <p>This not only secures the cable but also provides protection from a trowel when plastering, can be easier to fix with nails through the mortar of the brick but can be difficult to sit flush</p>
