<img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_18/img/Im9.png" /><p> Dug's First Christmas, with generosity in the air, and the season to be giving, it looks like its all in full swing...  </p><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_18/img/Im11.png" /><p>At Watt's Up we want to thank each and every one of you for the support, and to show our appreciation we are giving away £500 worth of </p><p>tools in a CHRISTMAS GIVEAWAY! </p><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_18/img/Im18.png" /><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_18/img/Im20.png" /><p>One thing as an electrician that we overlook &amp; underestimate is how easy it is to get overloaded with our work schedule and organisation of the business. Below are some useful tips to hopefully save you money </p><p>and most importantly your TIME!  </p><p>TIME is MONEY! </p><div class="inline-2"><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_18/img/Im22.png" /><p>1. Paperwork Staying organised with paperwork is a crucial part of being an electrician. If it’s owning your own company or working for someone. We have all been there where we have forgot to do a test report or forgot to send out an invoice.  I overcome this by always carrying a tablet or laptop with me. With this I can get my reports done on-site or in the van. This also gives me instant access Tradify where I manage all my quotes &amp; scheduling. </p></div><p>2. Van Stock   </p><p>Rummaging through your van for 30 minutes straight to find a Wago only to find out you do not have one.  </p><div class="inline-2"><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_18/img/Im30.png" /><p>Which then you have to waste more time going to the wholesaler to get one.  Keeping your van stocked up and organised is a must, check out the spreadsheet example where the price </p></div><p>and part number is logged and updated </p><p>every so often. </p><div class="inline-2"><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_18/img/Im32.png" /><p>3. Documenting Your Work  When working on site and within people's home, it is always good practice to record and document everything you have done post-job, this can be done with simple photos. This ensures that once you leave the job, you know your work and the property you are in is left in a good condition, and if someone tries to say something different you are covered by your photos. </p></div><div class="inline-2"><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_18/img/Im34.png" /><p>This information can be stored in a free Google Drive. </p></div><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_18/img/Im36.png" /><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_18/img/Im40.png" /><p>Tradify the all-in-one job management tool, making it easy to manage your quotes, estimates, invoices, payments, scheduling &amp; more! </p><p>Quoting has never been easier! Tradify's newest feature, quote options, lets you offer all of your options on one quote, saving you time and limiting revisions with your customers. </p><p>Jimbo's favourite feature is the ability to have pre-made emails, invoices and quotes. This saves him so much time as he only has to change very small details and can get a quote out in as little as 60 seconds </p><p>Exclusive Discount Code: JIMBO50 50% off for 3 months </p><p>Click here for a 14 day Trial! </p><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_18/img/Im47.png" /><p>What is Neutral Diversion Current...? </p><p>Diverted neutral currents is a topic which is becoming more important. An event can occur if there is a break in the protective earth and </p><p>neutral (PEN) conductor in the distribution network, supplying an installation with a TNC-S earthing arrangement. This then has the </p><p>potential for current to flow down the protective conductor, exposed </p><p>metallic structural parts of the building, water/gas pipes and much more. (We don’t need to say how dangerous that is)   </p><p>You might ask how does this happen. Well there is lots of events that </p><p>can cause this such as:  </p><p>Deterioration in electrical equipment Cable damage </p><p>Poor/Loose connections </p><p>There isn't anything us as electricians can do to stop this, but what we </p><p>can do is make more electricians aware about the danger and how we can keep ourselves safe from it. </p><p>Example of the danger: If you are replacing a consumer unit and haven't checked the earth </p><p>leakage current on the bonding conductor, then please do.  </p><p>When this is disconnected while doing your board change this could have a large amount of current flowing through it which is extremely </p><p>dangerous as we know. </p><p>PLEASE go and watch the following videos for a much better </p><p>understanding from people who are hugely respected in the electrical </p><p>industry and make yourself aware of more danger. </p><p> Diverted Neutral Currents - Apprentice 121 </p><p> Diverted Neutral Currents - </p><p>John Ward </p><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_18/img/Im57.png" /><p>Every tradesman knows their tools inside and out. But can you guess </p><p>these everyday tools/materials that we as electricians use...  </p><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_18/img/Im59.png" /><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_18/img/Im61.png" /><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_18/img/Im63.png" /><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_18/img/Im71.png" /><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_18/img/Im73.png" /><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_18/img/Im75.png" /><p>The biggest part of being a tradesman is looking after your tools, van </p><p>and staying on top of paper work... but the most important tool you own is your MIND. </p><p>We will be donating 10% of any profit made from this newsletter.
