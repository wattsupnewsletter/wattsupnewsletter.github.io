            <p>One thing as an electrician that we overlook &amp; underestimate is how easy it is to get overloaded with our work schedule and organisation of the business. Below are some useful tips to hopefully save you money and most importantly your TIME!  </p>
            <p>TIME is MONEY! </p>

                    <h3>1. Paperwork</h3> <p>Staying organised with paperwork is a crucial part of being an electrician. If it’s owning your own company or working for someone. We have all been there where we have forgot to do a test report or forgot to send out an invoice.  I overcome this by always carrying a tablet or laptop with me. With this I can get my reports done on-site or in the van. This also gives me instant access Tradify where I manage all my quotes &amp; scheduling. </p>

            <div class="col">
                <h3>2. Van Stock</h3> <p>Rummaging through your van for 30 minutes straight to find a Wago only to find out you do not have one. Which then you have to waste more time going to the wholesaler to get one.  Keeping your van stocked up and organised is a must, check out the spreadsheet example where the price and part number is logged and updated every so often.</p>

                <h3>3. Documenting Your Work</h3>
                    <p>When working on site and within people's home, it is always good practice to record and document everything you have done post-job, this can be done with simple photos. This ensures that once you leave the job, you know your work and the property you are in is left in a good condition, and if someone tries to say something different you are covered by your photos. </p>

            <p>What is Neutral Diversion Current...? </p>
            <p>Diverted neutral currents is a topic which is becoming more important. An event can occur if there is a break in the protective earth and neutral (PEN) conductor in the distribution network, supplying an installation with a TNC-S earthing arrangement. This then has the potential for current to flow down the protective conductor, exposed metallic structural parts of the building, water/gas pipes and much more. (We don’t need to say how dangerous that is)</p>
            <p>You might ask how does this happen. Well there is lots of events that can cause this such as:  </p>
            <p>Deterioration in electrical equipment Cable damage </p>
            <p>Poor/Loose connections </p>
            <p>There isn't anything us as electricians can do to stop this, but what we can do is make more electricians aware about the danger and how we can keep ourselves safe from it. </p>
            <p>Example of the danger:</p>
            <p> If you are replacing a consumer unit and haven't checked the earth </p>
            <p>leakage current on the bonding conductor, then please do.  </p>
            <p>When this is disconnected while doing your board change this could have a large amount of current flowing through it which is extremely dangerous as we know. </p>
            <p>PLEASE go and watch the following videos for a much better understanding from people who are hugely respected in the electrical industry and make yourself aware of more danger. </p>
