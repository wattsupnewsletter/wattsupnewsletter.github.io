<h3><b>10 Facts About Distribution Boards!</b></h3>
<div style="text-align: left;">
    <ol>
        <li><b>Board Hight must be set 1.2m from Ground</b>
        <p>Did you know a board should be mounted at approximately 1.2m high, This is not
        only for easy access for most but also for people in wheelchairs as they can
            access the consumer unit in case of a fault.</p></li>

        <li><b>Max 1mm Hole on top & Front of CU/DB</b>
<p>Did you know we are not allowed no more than a 1mm hole in
diameter at the top and front of a consumer unit/distribution board,
    as this doesn’t meet the ingress protection requirements (IP4X).</p></li>

        <li><b>Gaps Between RCBO's</b>
<p>Did you know it is best practice to space out your RCBOs as they can
build up a large thermal signature, and this will help them dispute the
heat? If RCBOs get hot this can cause all sorts of issues such as not
    operating correctly.</p></li>
        <li><b>RCD Maximum Leakage</b>
<p>30% of a 30mA RCD gives a maximum allowable amount of 9mA
leakage for normal operation. This requirement may be hard to meet
if you have several circuits protected by one RCD and you don’t know
    what equipment will be used in the installation.</p></li>

        <li><b>Isolating Line Conductors</b>
<p>Three-phase distribution boards generally have 3-pole switch
disconnectors which isolate all line conductors but not the neutral.
This is fine for TN-C-S and TN-S systems providing protective bonding
is installed and the neutral conductor is reliably connected to Earth by
    a low resistance (see Regulation 461.2).</p></li>

        <li><b>SPD & MET Protection</b>
<p>The minimum protective conductor size needed for connection
between SPD and MET is 6mm2 copper or equivalent. As for Type 2
SPDs, it is 16mm2 for Type 1 SPDs
The total length of conductors between connection points of the SPD
assembly should not exceed 0.5 m (preferably) and in no case exceed
    1.0 m.</p></li>

        <li><b>Torquing Your Terminals</b>
<p>Every consumer unit has torque settings. If the screws are not
correctly tightened this can cause under tightening or over tightening.
Which can lead to many issues such as loose connections and damage
    to the equipment.</p></li>

        <li><b>RCD Maintenance</b>
<p>RCDs should be checked at a maximum interval of every 6 months by
pressing the test button. This then lubricates the mechanics of the
RCD to ensure mechanical operation. This used to be a quarterly test
    but in recent years has changed.</p></li>

        <li><b>Correct Screwdriver Bit</b>
<p>Many screws in consumer units are not what most people believe to
be PZ2 but SL/PZ2 so always make sure to use the correct
screwdriver end for the job. ALWAYS refer to manufacturer
    instructions.</p>

</li>
<li><b>KA Rating?</b>
<p>What is the KA rating on a Protective device? It is the maximum the
protective device can handle to safely isolate under fault conditions. If
the KA goes above the maximum, the protective device may not
    operate safely and correctly.</p></li>

<h3><b>RCBO Heat Effecting Performance</b></h3>
<p>The performance of Residual Current Circuit Breakers with
Overcurrent Protection (RCBOs) can be influenced when installed next
to each other within an electrical panel or enclosure. Several factors
need consideration to ensure their safe and dependable operation,
The various concerns are the following:</p>

<p><b>Heat Dissipation</b></p>
<p>The tight placement of RCBOs restricts airflow and reduces heat
dissipation which increases operating temperatures, which can
compromise performance, reduce longevity and potentially make the
installation unsafe. Always refer to manufacturers' instructions to see
what they recommend. It is best practice to space out your RCBOs
where possible and this will help with heat dissipation from other
RCBOs.</p>
<img src="/assets/img/newsletters/Volume8/X30.png" class="d-block img-fluid mb-2 rounded mx-auto"/>
<p><b>Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)</b></p>
<p>When RCBOs are closely situated, electromagnetic interference
between devices may impact sensitivity to fault currents and trip
characteristics.</p>

<p><b>Temperature Rise</b></p>
<p>You may ask where the heat stems from. This is caused by the coil
inside the RCBO which gets hot under operation. So when placed in
between another RCBO on either side it is a lot harder for the heat to
dissipate.</p>

<p>The most <u>STOLEN</u> van in the UK has been confirmed it's the
<b>Mercedes-benz Sprinter 313 CDI</b> with a total of 938 thefts
followed by the Sprinter 314 CDI at 660 and the Ford Transit 350
ranked third, with 601 reported stolen according to the DVLA.</p>

<p>Last year, van thefts surged to 12,950 in the UK, up 18% from 2022.
Despite being fewer than car thefts, which rose 5% to 64,087, drivers
remain vulnerable to vehicle theft.</p>
