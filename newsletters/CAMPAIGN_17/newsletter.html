            <p>Anyone who intends to work on an electrical system should be equipped with an electrical safe isolation kit.   </p>
            <p>The TIS 850SIKIT is probably the most affordable safe isolation kit containing a GS38 compliant voltage &amp; continuity tester, proving unit &amp; safety lockout kit for locking off various types of breakers.   </p>
            <p>The padlock importantly includes only one single key with an etched serial number to match the lock, meaning the chance of someone else having another key to open that padlock is almost impossible.   </p>
            <p>During the month of October, we are offering an extra 20% off the usual 'street price' when using the code below , taking the cost down to a very affordable £92.00 +VAT. </p>
            <p>Throughout October you can use the special code for the added discount at any TIS stockist, Solar &amp; Storage Live &amp; NAPIT Leeds events. </p>
            <p>Exclusive Discount Code: JIMBOSIKIT </p>

            <p>Should I Start my own Social Media? </p>
            <p>The answer is simple... YES. Not so you can get free tools or paid sponsorship (although they are nice perks). It's about building a personal brand, to showcase your abilities and skills and network with people within your sector/niche. </p>
            <p>Tips to get Started: </p>
            <p>First figure out what you want to talk about, and why you are talking about it. It has to be something your passionate about, you want to spread awareness or you just want to give advice, be really specific on your WHY this will be the driving force. </p>
            <p>What type of content are you going to post will depend on the platform, there are only 3 ways in which you can communicate to engage with your audience, written word, video &amp; audio now depending if you want to include your face or not will depend what path you go down. Written Word - Medium Blogs, LinkedIn, WordPress Video - YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, Instagram Audio - Soundcloud, Stitcher, Google Voice, iTunes (Podcast) </p>
            <p>How to get noticed is another thing you have to understand the mechanics of, you either leverage your Time or Money. If you've got Money you can use Google/Facebook Ads  to push your content to your desired audience, otherwise if you have time you need to start creating and create a lot of content in as many places as you can to gain the most exposure to every eyeball you can. </p>
            <p>"When Should I Start Posting".... The best time to get involved in social media was yesterday, the 2nd best time is today! </p>

                <p> Fact 1: Electricity travels at the speed of light, approximately 270,000 kilometres per second. Which is equivalent to going around the earth 7 times a second Fact 2: The first street in the world to be lit by   </p>

                <p>an electric light bulb was Mosley Street, Newcastle upon Tyne, in 1879. Fact 3: The word “electrocute” is a combination of the words electro and execute, meaning you were killed by electricity. So, if you don’t die, you were not electrocuted, only shocked.
