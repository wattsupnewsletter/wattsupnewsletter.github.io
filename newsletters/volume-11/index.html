    <h5 style="color: black;"><b>What is a Bi-Directional device & why are we talking about it?</b></h5>
    <p>This protective device is used in electrical installations to provide protection against
    faults where current flow is in both directions. Traditionally, protective devices such
    as circuit breakers are designed to only interrupt current flow on the load side.</p>

    <p>Bi-Directional protective devices are important in systems where power can flow in
    both directions, such as those incorporating renewable energy sources, where
    power is given back to the grid.</p>
</div>

<img src="/assets/img/newsletters/Volume11/X11.png" class="d-block img-fluid mb-2 rounded mx-auto" />
<div style="text-align: left;">
    <h5 style="color: black;"><b>Difference In Devices</b></h5>
    <p>Unidirectional protective devices should be marked to specify the line and load
    terminals and are designed to operate when the power can only flow in one direction
    for example from the supply >>> load.</p>

    <p>A Bi-Directional device does not have markings to specify  line and load terminals
    where power can flow in either direction and will not cause damage. Always check
    with the manufacturer if you are unsure.</p>

    <p>Why have we brought them into the newsletter this month? In the last few weeks
    The IET has proposed Amendment 3:2024 to BS7671:2018. You might be thinking
    "oh no loads of changes and a new book". Well this is not the case, as there is just
    one change, which you will be able to download and use to alongside the big brown
    book.</p>
</div>

<img src="/assets/img/newsletters/Volume11/X16.png" class="d-block img-fluid mb-2 rounded mx-auto" />
<p>So essentially when a current can flow in both directions a Bi-Direction protective device must be used.</p>

<p>If you want to give feedback on this amendment you can <a href="https://electrical.theiet.org/bs-7671/updates-to-18th-edition" style="color: var(--theme-primary);">click here</a>, but you only
have until the 5th of June 2024. Usually we are given 12 weeks to provide feedback
but in this case we only had 4 weeks, this would indicate that the IET really wants to
get this implemented quickly.</p>

<p>Below are some videos that detail the change from different perspectives.</p>

    <p>Consumer Units ✔️</p>
    <p>Circuit Protection Devices ✔️</p>
    <p>A brand that wont let you down...?</p>

    <p>Verso, a trusted name in the consumer unit and circuit protection device industry,
    has recently undergone a rebranding and is now known as <a href="https://www.versoelectrical.co.uk/" style="color: var(--theme-primary);">Navitas</a>. This new
    identity reflects their commitment to innovation and energy, aligning perfectly with
    their mission to deliver top-tier electrical solutions.</p>

    <h5 style="color: black;">What Is A Motor?</h5>

    <p>A motor is a device that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. It
    works by electromagnetic induction, where an electric current creates a
    magnetic field that interacts with other magnetic fields to produce motion.</p>

    <p>To keep it simple, when you give it electricity, it starts rotating, making it useful for many things like powering fans, pumps, machines and even vehicles.</p>

    <h5 style="color: black;">Motor Configurations</h5>
    <p>Star and delta are two different configurations used in three-phase induction motors.</p>

            <h5 style="color: black;">Star (Y) Connection</h5>
            <ul style="text-align: left;">
                <li>In a star connection, the three ends of the windings are connected to form a common point.</li>
                <li>Each winding is connected to a different phase of the three- phase power supply.</li>
                <li>Star-connected motors are typically used when the motor needs to start with a lower current draw.
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h5 style="color: black;">Delta (Δ) Connection</h5>
            <ul style="text-align: left;">
                <li>In a delta connection, each winding is connected in series to form a closed loop, resembling the Greek letter delta (Δ).</li>
                <li>The three-phase power supply is directly connected to the ends of these windings.</li>
                <li>Delta-connected motors usually have higher starting torque compared to star-connected motors.</li>
            </ul>
