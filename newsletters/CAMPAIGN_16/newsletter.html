<img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_16/img/Im7.png" /><p> Last Month the board fault was a breeze to solve with the TIS testing kit, now on earth let's find a home... </p><hr><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_16/img/Im10.png" /><p>Every year new electrical innovation's are introduced to the world, but let's go back in time to when these ground breaking innovations were created. </p><p>Try to guess in what order these devices were founded.  Answer at the bottom </p><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_16/img/Im18.png" /><hr><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_16/img/Im20.png" /><p>Although it's overlooked the CPC is probably the most important conductor, so let's learn more... </p><div class="inline-2"><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_16/img/Im22.png" /><p>1. Sizing Your CPC This is not used commonly in domestic installations, but if you do a lot of commercial work, this Adiabatic equation will help calculate the CSA of the CPC. When oversizing your CPC on a large commercial job, it can potentially lead to thousands of pounds wasted. </p></div><p>Ref: BS7671, Page 199,  543.1.3 </p><div class="inline-2"><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_16/img/Im24.png" /><p>2. CPC Colour Identification   The green and yellow colour identification combination shall cover from a minimum of 30% and at most 70%. For example 40% yellow and 60% green. This regulation is commonly misconceived to what percentage you should sleeve a cable. </p></div><p>Ref: BS7671, Page 132,  514.4.2 </p><div class="inline-2"><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_16/img/Im31.png" /><p>3. Un-insulated CPCThe CPC is intentionally not insulated in T&amp;E cable to make sure that if the cable is accidentally cut or drilled, there's a higher likelihood of encountering the CPC first. This is an important safety measure. </p></div><hr><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_16/img/Im33.png" /><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_16/img/Im35.png" /><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_16/img/Im37.png" /><p>TIS 560 AC &amp; TIS 570 AC &amp; DC Earth Leakage clamp meters. </p><p>Both instruments are massive time savers for board changes &amp; finding AC leakage problems causing nuisance RCD tripping.  </p><p>For the month of November, use promo code below for an extra 12.5% discount off of the usual ’street price’ for both products, taking them down to: </p><p>TIS 560 AC Leakage Clampmeter £105.00 +VAT TIS 570 AC &amp; DC Leakage Clampmeter £210 +VAT </p><p>Exclusive Discount Code: JIMBOLEAKAGE </p><a href="https://www.testinstrumentsolutions.co.uk/digital-clampmeters-and-accessories/tis-560-earth-leakage-clampmeter">Check it Out! </a><hr><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_16/img/Im45.png" /><p>Why is being able to detect DC leakage so important? </p><p>DC leakage is now increasingly prevalent due to Electric Vehicle batteries, Solar PV &amp; battery storage systems.  If more than 6mA of DC leakage flows in a circuit, then all AC, A &amp; F type RCDs will be ‘blinded’ &amp; therefore may not trip in a fault condition.   </p><p>The installation of a ‘B’ type RCD or ‘RDC DD’ would then pick up the pure DC leakage current &amp; therefore trip if there is more than 6mA of DC leakage.   </p><p>The bigger picture with detecting DC leakage is also that it can propagate to different properties, meaning a house without any DC current generating equipment could be effected by a neighbour who has - therefore the detection of DC leakage is vitally important.  At the time of writing this proposal, the TIS 570 is the only combined AC &amp; DC leakage clampmeter currently readily available on the UK market. </p><p>DC leakage, if left unchecked can also cause corrosion within the fabric of metal &amp;/or metal reinforced buildings. </p><p>Ref: TIS  </p><a href="https://www.testinstrumentsolutions.co.uk/digital-clampmeters-and-accessories/tis-570-acdc-earth-leakage-clampmeter"> Earth Leakage Clampmeter! </a><hr><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_16/img/Im47.png" /><p>If your someone like me who likes to watch electrical content for entertainment, education and to stay up to date check out the guys below. </p><p>These 3 accounts are a just few of the many creators I admire  </p><div class="inline-3"><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_16/img/Im49.png" /><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_16/img/Im51.png" /><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_16/img/Im53.png" /></div><div class="inline-3"><p>David Savery  </p><p>OY Electrical  </p><p>OM Electrical  </p></div><div class="inline-3"><p>Knowledgeable and trustworthy guy that provide clear information without the bullshit</p><p>This guy has taken electrical YouTube content to the next level while providing great entertainment value</p><p>Growing his following very quick and its no surprise as his daily TikTok's are engaging and fun to watch</p></div><div class="inline-3"></div><div class="inline-3"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/dseselectric/">Instagram </a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/oyelectrical/">Instagram </a><a href="https://www.instagram.com/omelectrical_/">Instagram </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@dsesuk">YouTube</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@corymac">YouTube</a><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@omelectrical_">TikTok</a></div><hr><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_16/img/Im61.png" /><img src="/newsletters/CAMPAIGN_16/img/Im63.png" /><p>The biggest part of being a tradesman is looking after your tools, van, staying on top of paper work... but the most important tool you own is your MIND. </p><p>We will be donating 10% of any profit made from this newsletter.
